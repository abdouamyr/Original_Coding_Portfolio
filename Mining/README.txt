Mining is inspired by the Flash Game “Motherload.” It employs concepts of randomization, collision detection, and basic physics. 

The game is controlled with the WASD keys. The objective is to mine all the pieces of gold. The mining machine will explode if it runs out of gas. This can be prevented by collecting barrels of fuel. Using the propulsors (W) also burns fuel.
